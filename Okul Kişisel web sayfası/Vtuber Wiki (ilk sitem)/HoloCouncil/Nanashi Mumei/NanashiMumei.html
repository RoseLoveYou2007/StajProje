      <tr>
        <td>Mumei is shy and can be nervous during streams. However, she can be rather emotive, and is known for her hearty wheezing laugh, which is often heard due to her tendency to laugh at nearly anything. She often vocalizes and hums randomly, which has been compared to bird chirps or "birb noises".</td>

        <td>At debut, Hakos Baelz described Mumei as having the cutest voice in hololive -Council-, though she has also demonstrated a rather unexpectedly wide vocal range, along with a tendency to emit high-pitched screeches when surprised or agitated.[3] Her fans and even other members of hololive, particularly Ceres Fauna, have developed some degree of protectiveness for her, due to her soft nature giving a "little sister" vibe.</td>

Due to not being created by the Gods, she was free to choose her own appearance, and decided to make herself owl-like, after the bird that symbolizes wisdom.</td>

          <td>She is gentle, wise, and an unbelievably hard worker. As a well-traveled vagabond, she is blessed with a wealth of knowledge of the world. She has seen, heard, and experienced so many things that she has forgotten most of them, one of them being her own name.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>For some reason, she seems to project a rather pitiable aura. Perhaps this is in part thanks to the loneliness she has often felt in her perennial travels.

            <td>Her age is unknown, as she has forgotten it. However, going from the trends of her genmates, Mumei is likely as old as human civilization, which would make her the youngest member of the Council, as Civilization is much younger than the ages provided by the council members (the ages Earth, the universe, and infinity). Logically, the existence of Civilization, an artificial creation, is far younger than abstract concepts like Nature, Space, Time, and Chaos.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>If Mumei is assumed to be as old as recorded civilization, it would put her at 5,000-6,000 years old; if she is instead assumed to be as old as humanity (ie. Homo sapiens), this would make her about 200,000-300,000 instead. In her debut stream, she remarked that she has been recording human history for about 6,000 years, making it likely the former.</td>
