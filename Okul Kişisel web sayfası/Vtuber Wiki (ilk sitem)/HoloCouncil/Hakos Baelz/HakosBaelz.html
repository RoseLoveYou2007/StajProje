        <td><h2>Personality</h2>Hakos Baelz is loud, unpredictable, and chaotic. Despite this, she seems to have a talent for leading off in discussions and keeping things as orderly as possible, as seen in the first hololive -Council- meeting. Ceres Fauna even described her as a natural born leader, and Baelz eventually embraced the role of "Leader of -Council-." In contrast to her chaotic nature, she speaks rather fondly of the other -Council- members, and is regarded by them as adorable in turn. Baelz can also be easily flustered if things do not go her way.</td>

            <td>Technically, Baelz is in error: "dice" is the plural; "die" is the singular.<br>
                If a six-sided die is used, this could make her anywhere between 30-180 years old in human years.<br>
                The first time Baelz rolled a die for her age, it was a 9,999,999-sided die and the result was 2,347,180.</td>
