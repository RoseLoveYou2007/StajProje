        <td><h2>Personality</h2>Tsukumo Sana has a light-hearted and sometimes childish attitude. She has an interest in both astronomy and astrology, and often makes references to space. She is fond of her fellow hololive -Council- members. Sana enjoys stating fun facts, particularly those with large numbers. She may also have a tendency to exaggerate, as the age and unrestricted height she wrote in her debut were off by an order of magnitude.</td>

          <td>"Space" refers not only to this universe we live in, but all dimensions and matter to exist. It is a concept unbridled by definition, and one that continues to grow in scope limitlessly. As it is yet to be fully explored by man, her seemingly strange behavior and speech can be explained away with a simple, "Humanity simply isn't yet ready to understand."</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Sana is larger than Earth's Sun, but shrank down to human size in order to experience Earth. The antenna on her head is a limiter which prevents her height from increasing. If removed, her gravitational field would fling Earth out of orbit and kill the entire human race.</td>

            <td>Although Sana described her true height at debut as approximately 1.7 trillion centimeters (17 million kilometers), the chart depicting her to scale next to Earth's Sun showed her to be only slightly larger. Since the Sun has a diameter of 1.4 million km, a height of 170 billion cm (1.7 million km) is likely to have been the intended figure.</td>

            <td>In her debut stream, Sana wrote her age as 138 billion years, although this is likely another error. She read it as 13(.8) billion years old, consistent with the current estimates of the age of the universe.</td>
