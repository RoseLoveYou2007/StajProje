      <tr>
        <td><h2>Personality</h2>Gura is friendly and readily likeable, and often amuses her viewers with foolish antics. She has no sense of direction, often misspells and mispronounces words, has trouble remembering her own age, and consistently fails to solve basic math problems, leading viewers to affectionately call her a "dum shark".

          She is also chronically lazy at times, as in one instance she left a raw egg in the sink under a plate for 3 weeks before taking notice to the foul odor and fuzz, eats baby food "because you don't have to cook it, you don't have to chew on it, ya know! Just eat!" as well as being caught naked when she was doing her pre-debut video meetings with her fellow Gen-mates, which has made her the butt of their jokes.
          
          However, despite her poor math and spelling skills, Gura is quick-witted, clever, and has vast knowledge of Shark Facts. When questioned on why she was not "boing boing", she excused it by claiming that she was "hydrodynamic". Her skill with fast-paced rhythm games is exceptional, and she is highly ambitious. She also occasionally makes lewd jokes, and is familiar with modern meme culture.</td>

She forgot her exact age some time around 5,000s, and when asked gives a random number in the 9,000s range.</td>
