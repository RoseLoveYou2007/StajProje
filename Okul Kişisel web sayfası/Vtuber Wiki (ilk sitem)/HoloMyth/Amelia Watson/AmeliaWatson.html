        <td>Watson Amelia is an English Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, as part of its English (EN) branch first generation of Vtubers alongside Ninomae Ina'nis, Takanashi Kiara, Mori Calliope, and Gawr Gura.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><h2>Personality</h2>Amelia is a rather expressive girl who is often seen mingling or teasing her fellow holomyth members (mostly Gura). She is usually kind, supportive, and sweet as shown when she often willingly helps the bonehead Gura in Minecraft and is furthermore expressed when she frequently watches her fellow members' streams whenever she is available (she even ended her own stream just to watch Kiara's stream once).</td>          
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Despite her cute angelic appearance and personality, she also harbors another side of her personality that is often referred by her fans as "Gremlin Mode", she can be greedy, prideful, and unsportsmanlike in competitive online games such as Fall Guys, Apex Legends, and Valorant. Her greed is furthermore demonstrated in The Witcher 3 when she is always searching for loot, given the fact that when she heard a nearby villager say "loot", she tried to go around and find loot. For these reasons, fans often refer to her as a "True Gamer". Despite the circumstances, she tries her best to moderate her gremlin-like behavior.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Additionally, Amelia also enjoys clowning around such as in Gura's stream. During the pizza subject, she teased her by typing "Peanut Butter Pizza" in the stream's chat. And another time is her well-known proclamation of being a "Zoomer". She can also be sadistic sometimes, as she trolled her viewers in one of her Minecraft streams by adjusting her shader's brightness very darkly and acts innocently in claiming that she fixed the shaders for them, she fixed it again but the screen just became pitch black that they can't even see a single thing until she finally stopped and said that she was just kidding.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Moreover, she is often mischievous and lewd as she made a door in Minecraft written on top of it with "Gura's Backdoor" and a mischievous emoji. During her tour with Gawr Gura and Moona Hoshinova in hololive Japanese server, she was below Gura while climbing a ladder and commented "Nice view from here". Another is when the word "bottom" is said by both Calliope and Gura at different times, she responds by referring to them as the "bottom".</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Possibly her best-known joke is "ground pounding your mom", which she said once during a Super Mario Odyssey playthrough and has since become almost synonymous with her character. Generally, Amelia's voice will shift towards a naughtier tone when she says something gremlin-like.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>When she learned about the "lewd" fanarts of her by her fans and eventually likes it, she coined the tag "#Amelewds" that she proclaimed for them to use whenever they want to post "lewd" fanarts of her, ostensibly in order to separate SFW and NSFW art.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Overall, her multiple sides of her personality and having a balanced chemistry of it are what makes her very lovable as noted by her fans.</td>

        <td>She was introduced simultaneously on both hololive's regular and English Twitter accounts and on hololive English's YouTube channel in a small video with the rest of the first generation on 8 September 2020. Her Twitter account was created in July, with her first tweet on her official introduction going out on 8 September. Her YouTube channel was created on 16 July, with her debut on 13 September (JST) during a stream.</td>
