                <td><h2>Personality</h2>Kiara is enthusiastic and friendly, and is open with her feelings. She cares strongly for her friends and family, and misses them a great deal while she is abroad. Although energetic and sometimes chaotic in nature, and eager to collab with other members, she is secretly quite shy. She is sometimes bird-brained, being forgetful or having a short attention span. She prefers video games with fixed goals, such as RPGs, rather than open-world games like Minecraft.

                    On a graph ranking members in purity and intelligence, Kiara was rated "bottom left"—maximum lewd and foolish, much to her bemusement. However, she often surprises viewers with moments of gentleness, compassion, and insightful wisdom.
                    
                    Watson Amelia, in her debut stream, described Kiara as having a "positive attitude and lovely voice". Mori Calliope described her as a hard worker and an incredible singer with a great personality, and praised her fluency with Japanese.
                    
                    Kiara has a particular fondness for Mori Calliope. Kiara, a phoenix who has been continuously reborn, always meets Calliope each time she dies. However, it is not within Calliope's power to keep a phoenix in the Underworld.</td>

Around six hours later, the channel was restored.</td>

She addressed holoEN members as "senpai" (senior) and even forgot who Calli was. By the end of the stream she recovered her memory and commented on her temporary account termination.Amelia Watson later said she really admired Kiara for her clever handling of the situation, which turned a setback into something positive.</td>
